# React Breakpoints

> Demonstrating the future of responsive web design by combining a `ResizeObserver` with hooks and components.

To make my talk more interactive, I wrote this Storybook library as an alternative to static slides.

Demonstrates the use of [@envato/react-breakpoints](https://github.com/envato/react-breakpoints).

## Running this presentation

```shell
git clone git@github.com:mdingena/react-breakpoints-demo
cd react-breakpoints-demo/
npm install # you may also need to install some peer dependencies manually
```

Now open `./storybook-static/index.html` in a browser window to launch the presentation.

**All slides up until the demos at the end were designed to be viewed at 200% browser zoom for screen sharing during a presentation.** Your mileage may vary.
