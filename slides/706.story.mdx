import { Meta } from '@storybook/addon-docs/blocks'

<Meta title="React Breakpoints/Consume the observation" />

The last piece to the puzzle is to consume this information in `Parent`, `Sibling`, and/or `Child`.

```jsx
import { useBreakpoints } from '@envato/react-breakpoints'

const Child = () => {
  const [label] = useBreakpoints({
    widths: {
      0: 'small',
      300: 'medium',
      600: 'large'
    }
  })

  return (
    <div className={label}>
      The observed element is currently within the {label} range.
    </div>
  )
}
```

And that's it! When the sidebar element changes size, `Child` will respond accordingly.
