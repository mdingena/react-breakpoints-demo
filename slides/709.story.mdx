<Meta title="React Breakpoints/Observing height and handling SSR" />

Another thing to note is that you are not restricted to `widths`.

Although those are generally used far more often, you _can_ have vertical breakpoints.

```javascript
const [widthMatch, heightMatch] = useBreakpoints({
  widths: {
    0: 'mobile',
    769: 'tablet',
    1025: 'desktop'
  },
  heights: {
    480: 'SD', /* returns `undefined` for heights <= 479 */
    720: 'HD Ready',
    1080: 'Full HD',
    2160: '4K'
  }
})
```

Note how `heights` doesn't define a value for heights between `0` and `480`.

The hook will return `undefined` when the observed element is less than 480 pixels high. This is by design and makes sense, since you left the value for that range undefined.

It's a Good Idea ™️ to provide a value for key `0` so that the hook always returns something. Now it will _only_ return `undefined` in a Server-Side Rendering scenario, which allows you to use the undefined value to fall back to another value to use in SSR.
