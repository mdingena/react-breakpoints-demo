import { Meta } from '@storybook/addon-docs/blocks'

<Meta title="React Breakpoints/Observe an element" />

Then, you wrap a portion of your app with an `Observe` component.

Everything rendered through this component gains access to its context, which is updated with the observed element's size.

```jsx
import { Observe } from '@envato/react-breakpoints'

const MyObservingComponent = () => (
  <Observe
    render={({ observedElementProps }) => (
      <Parent>
        <Sibling />
        <aside {...observedElementProps}>
          <Child />
        </aside>
      </Parent>
    )}
  />
)
```

You can observe any block-like DOM element. Also, `Parent`, `Sibling`, and `Child` all have access to this sidebar's size, as they are all rendered inside `Observe`.
