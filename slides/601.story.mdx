<Meta title="Using ResizeObservers/Summary" />

You create a ResizeObserver by calling its constructor with a callback function argument. This is a function that will be called every time the ResizeObserver observes a resize on the observed elements.

Note how I use "elements", _plural_.

**You can use a single ResizeObserver to observe multiple elements**.

The only restriction here is that the it will use the same callback for all those elements.
