<Meta title="React Breakpoints/Consuming without the hook" />

### That's the setup in a nutshell. But there is more! ðŸ˜±

You don't _have_ to use `useBreakpoints()` to consume observations. You can directly access your breakpoint values in `Observe`'s render function.

```jsx
const MyObservingComponent = () => (
  <Observe
    box='border-box'
    breakpoints={{
      box: 'content-box',
      widths: {
        0: 'mobile',
        769: 'tablet',
        1025: 'desktop'
      },
      heights: {
        0: 'SD',
        720: 'HD-Ready',
        1080: 'Full HD',
        2160: '4K'
      }
    }}
    render={({ observedElementProps, widthMatch, heightMatch }) => (
      <>
        {/* this element is given a class based on a child sidebar's width */}
        <article className={widthMatch}>

          {/* this sidebar is observed */}
          <aside {...observedElementProps}>

            {/* this component uses `useBreakpoints()` to adapt to the sidebar's size */}
            <MyResponsiveComponent />

          </aside>

          {/* this component receives one of the `heights` strings defined above based on the sidebar's height */}
          <MyVideoComponent quality={heightMatch} />
        </article>

        {/* this component also uses `useBreakpoints()` to adapt to the sidebar's size, but from outside the sidebar */}
        <MyResponsiveComponent />
      </>
    )}
  />
);
```
