### Browser support

Another thing you might've noticed is the usage of `box` properties. This brings me to ResizeObserver's browser support.

Currently, it's not very well supported, and browsers haven't caught up with the latest spec yet.

By default, any ResizeObserver only observes and reports an element's `contentRect`. But the spec also outlines `borderBoxSize`, `contentBoxSize`, and `devicePixelContentBoxSize`.

You can gain access to these boxSizes by either monkey-patching `window.ResizeObserver`, or preferably by using a ponyfill.

```jsx
import { Provider as ResizeObserverProvider } from '@envato/react-breakpoints'
import { ResizeObserver } from '@juggle/resize-observer' // Ponyfill

const App = () => (
  <ResizeObserverProvider ponyfill={ResizeObserver}>
    â€¦
  </ResizeObserverProvider>
)
```

Just pass a constructor to `ponyfill` and it'll be used instead of `window.ResizeObserver`.
