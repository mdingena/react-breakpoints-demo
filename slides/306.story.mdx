## Challenges of responsive design

But things can quickly become complicated. And still, all we are able to respond to is the window size.

An example.

Here is a page with two images inside it. For design reasons beyond our control, these images have to be 300 pixels wide.

<Preview>
  <Story name="test">
    <Page width='320px'>
      <div className='container'>
        <Figure author='Christian Holzinger' />
        <Figure author='Nitish Meena' />
      </div>
    </Page>
  </Story>
</Preview>
