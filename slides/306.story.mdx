<Meta title="Challenges of responsive design/Examples, part 1" />

But things can quickly become complicated. And still, all we are able to respond to is the window size.

An example.

Here is a page with two images inside it. For design reasons beyond our control, these images have to be at least 300 pixels wide.

<style>{`
  .example-1 {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
  }
`}</style>
<Preview>
  <Story name="stacked">
    <Page width='320px'>
      <div className='container example-1'>
        <Figure author='Christian Holzinger' />
        <Figure author='Nitish Meena' />
      </div>
    </Page>
  </Story>
</Preview>

We expect mobile devices using this design to have a window size of at least 320 pixels wide. That gives our designer the freedom to add 10 pixels of padding on both sides of the column.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

Ideally, our designer would like to show these two images side-by-side when we can.

Not forgetting the padding on both sides, and perhaps adding a 10 pixel gutter in between, we need to have at least 630 pixels of screen real estate. So off we go to write our @media query.

```css
@media (min-width: 630px) {
  .container {
    flex-direction: row;
  }
  .container figure:not(:last-of-type) {
    margin-right: 10px;
  }
}
```

<style>{`
  .example-2 {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
  }
  .example-2 figure:not(:last-of-type) {
    margin-right: 10px;
  }
`}</style>
<Preview>
  <Story name="side-by-side">
    <Page width='630px'>
      <div className='container example-2'>
        <Figure author='Christian Holzinger' />
        <Figure author='Nitish Meena' />
      </div>
    </Page>
  </Story>
</Preview>

Note that we have not defined the 10 pixels of padding on each side of the container.

This is because it's 2020, and most of us build a design out of components. The CSS for this padding is sitting in another file belonging to another component.

This highlights the first complication of modern responsive design.
