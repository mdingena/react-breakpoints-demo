### Power users 💪🏻

If you can't achieve what you wanted using `<Provider>`, `<Observe>`, and `useBreakpoints()`, I'm also exposing these:

* a `useResizeObserver()` hook to connect a DOM element in your component to the instantiated ResizeObserver on `<Provider>`.
* a `useResizeObserverEntry()` hook to retrieve the `ResizeObserverEntry` put on the nearest context. This is what `useBreakpoints()` uses under the hood.
