<Meta title="React Breakpoints/Examining useBreakpoints()" />

### Let's examine this hook's API.

We pass the hook an `options` object with a nested `widths` object.

```javascript
const [label] = useBreakpoints({
  widths: {
    0: 'small',
    300: 'medium',
    600: 'large'
  }
})
```

The keys works like CSS's `(min-width)`. The values are what's returned when the observed element's width matches a `(min-width)` key.
